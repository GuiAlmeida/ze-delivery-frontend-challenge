# Z√© Delivery Frontend Challenge

### Built With

- [React](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)

To maintain consistent code, this project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) as a linter and formatter.

## Quick Overview

Inside the project folder, you can run some commands:

### `npm install` or `yarn install`

Install the necessary dependencies:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


# About the Challenge 

The user needs to type an address inside a field and be redirected to a products list page. So your job as a front-end engineer will be to create 2 simple screens consuming and sending data to our API.

You can check out an example of this flow at: [https://ze.delivery/](https://ze.delivery/) (our production env)

We're using GraphQL (give a look to [https://www.graphql.com/guides/](https://www.graphql.com/guides/))

### Visual
We want you to feel free to develop the markup the way you want, we have no wireframes or something like that for this task. You will create 2 screens:
  - Home:
    - Needs to have a header, a footer and a input for the user to fill up with the address.
  - Products page:
    - We want to see the products as cards, with the product title, price and buttons to add/remove the product.

### About the API
The   API   link   is:    [https://api.code-challenge.ze.delivery/public/graphql](https://api.code-challenge.ze.delivery/public/graphql ) 
  - Home
    - To   find   the   latitude   and   longitude   of   an   address, you can use Google Maps API or use any other Geocoder API that you feel comfortable with.
    - Use   the   following   address   to   find   a   distributor (PoC):    Rua   AmeÃÅrico   Brasiliense,   SaÃÉo   Paulo . 
    - The   Query   needed   to   get   the   right   distributor   (get   the   first   distributor):
        - Query:       [https://bit.ly/32Gb2Qi](https://bit.ly/32Gb2Qi)
        - Arguments:
          - Algorithm:   "NEAREST".
          - Lat:   Use   as   String.
          - Long:   Use   as   String.
          - Now:   Pass   the   current   Date   formatted.
  - Product   List
      - The   Query   needed   to   get   the   products
        - Query:    [https://bit.ly/2N3JQ7k](https://bit.ly/2N3JQ7k)
        - Arguments:
          - Id:   id   of   the   distributor retrieved from the previous query (PocSearch).
          - Search:   if   ""   (empty),   does   not   filter   by   search.
          - CategoryId:   if   null,   does   not   filter   by   category.
      - The   Query   needed   to   get   the   category   list
        - Query:    [https://bit.ly/2pMG8Xy](https://bit.ly/2pMG8Xy)


### Tech Requirements (for both positions):
- You need to create a repo on GitHub to host your code
  - Github users:
      - @ze-engineering-code-challenge
- Avoid using scaffolds (Create React App etc.), we want to see how you make your project structure
- Keep it simple, no need for fancy stuff :)
- TESTS üíõ We really love testing our code and features here!
#### If you are running for a front-end position:
- You're not allowed to use any CSS Frameworks (Bootstrap, Bulma, PureCSS etc.)
- React will be a plus, but you can use whatever you want =)
- I want to be able to run your project locally by using `npm start`

#### If you are running for a mobile position:
- You should use React Native to develop your application.
- I want to be able to run your project with one single command
- Hosting it its a BIG plus (Expo should do the job for ya)


## Evaluation Method

Your code will be under review of the Z√© Engineering team. What we will look for:
- **Good Practices and patterns**
- **Code and Folder Structure**
- **Componentization and data flow**
- **Easy to understand code (again, no need for fancy stuff)**
- **Tests**

Feel free to implement it the way you feel more confortable :)
